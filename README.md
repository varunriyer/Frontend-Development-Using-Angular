# Frontend Development using Angular

## Overview

This repository focuses on front-end development using Angular 14+ and TypeScript. It is designed to build scalable, modular, and responsive single-page applications (SPAs). The project covers Angular CLI tools, component-based architecture, reusable modules, form handling, lifecycle hooks, and responsive UI design, along with modern styling practices using SCSS and media queries.

## Topics Covered

### Angular Core Concepts

- **Angular CLI**: Command-line interface for generating components, services, modules, and automating build processes.
- **Components & Reusability**: Building UI using modular components that are reusable, maintainable, and encapsulated.
- **Modules**: Organizing Angular applications into cohesive blocks of functionality.
- **Dependency Injection**: Injecting services and dependencies into components and modules for modular architecture.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Using hooks such as `ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`, `ngAfterViewInit`, etc., to manage component behavior during different phases of its lifecycle.

### TypeScript & Programming Essentials

- **Interfaces & Classes**: Strong typing using interfaces, and OOP concepts using classes in TypeScript.
- **Decorators**: Using Angular decorators like `@Component`, `@Injectable`, `@Input`, `@Output`, and `@ViewChild` for metadata and event communication.
- **Events**: Handling user and DOM events with Angular’s built-in event binding mechanisms.

### Forms Management

- **Reactive Forms**: Building complex, dynamic forms with custom validation and reactive bindings using `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, and `FormControl`.
- **Template-Driven Forms**: Simple, declarative approach using Angular templates and directives like `ngModel`.

### Advanced Angular Topics

- **Directives**: Custom and built-in directives (like `ngIf`, `ngFor`, `ngClass`, etc.) to control rendering and behavior.
- **Data Binding & Interpolation**: One-way and two-way data binding, string interpolation, and property/event binding.
- **Models & Tuples**: Structuring and type-defining data passed through components and services.

### Responsive Design & UI Enhancements

- **SCSS**: Writing modular, reusable, and nested styles using Sass preprocessor.
- **Media Queries**: Ensuring the application is responsive across devices and screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Adding dynamic transitions and effects using Angular’s animation APIs.
- **Local Storage**: Persisting data on the client side for session and preference management.
